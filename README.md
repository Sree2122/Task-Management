This is a basic command-line task manager written in C. It provides functionality to add, list, complete, and delete tasks.  Tasks are persisted between sessions by saving and loading them from a text file.  The project demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts, including data structures, file I/O, and basic user interface design.  It's a good starting point for learning more about building command-line applications in C.
